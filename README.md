# BasicSpawnProtection
Basic vanilla-like spawn protection for PocketMine-MP

## Configuration
After you first start the server with the plugin loaded, a default `config.yml` will be generated. You can then tweak the `radius` field to control how big the spawn protection zone will be.

## Permissions
- `basicspawnprotection.bypass` allows a user to bypass protection in the spawn area. This is restricted to OPs only by default.

## Limitations
Spawn protection currently applies to all worlds. If you don't want this, a more advanced plugin might be better to your taste.
